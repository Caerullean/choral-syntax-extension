# choral-syntax-extension README

This is a VScode extension for the Choral programming language. 

## Run locally
Clone the repository and open it up in VS Code. 

Then run in debug mode, either by pressing the keybind (default `f5`), or by opening the command prompt (defualt `ctrl+shift+p` or `cmd+shift+p`) and typing `Debug: Start Debugging`.

Then if a choral file is not already present, create a new one to see the effects of the extension.
